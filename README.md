# LSD Lisp Interpreter
This is a tree walk interpreter of a Lisp-inspired language. Right now it can really basic stuff and it's not super fast but it works.

# Features
- `if` - if statements
```lisp
    (if true (true branch) (else branch))
```
- `set` - variables
- `quote` - same as `'` in other Lisp dialects
- `alias` - set an alias for a variable

# Other features coming soon
- Functions
- More arithmetic operations
- `list`
- Macros maybe
